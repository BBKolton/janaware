	"text": "I came to pottery by chance in 1997, encountering an artist community in Southern Indiana while on a bike ride with a friend. In 1998, after visiting the same artist community a second time, I signed up for a pottery class and have been working with clay ever since. With my background as an engineer, I am extremely interested in craftsmanship and functionality. My influence comes from the traditional pottery forms (such as bowls, jugs and crocs) that people have been using in America for hundreds of years. I craft objects with clean lines and simple ornamentation meant for everyday use; such as bowls, bakers, jars, mugs, platters and pitchers. I also love color and glaze my pots with lots of bold yet sophisticated choices. I enjoy adding additional interest by using combinations of glazes that produce additional variations. Most recently, I have combined clay decorations and glaze combinations that \"move\" in the firing to produce strips or additional movement in my work. This is pottery that is meant to be used and enjoyed, each and every day"
