	"text": "JanaWare is handmade functional stoneware, created and for sale by Nancy Jana Kent. All JanaWare is individually hand made, usually on the potter's wheel, then altered, bisque, glazed and high fired. Each piece is created one at a time, focusing on functionality, quality, and beauty. Always, JanaWare is food safe and can be used in the dishwasher, microwave and oven. Please browse this site to see samples and learn a bit about my art and my motivation. You can find me and my pots at fine art fairs listed under Show Schedule. If you can't make a show, or are interested in something special, please contact me. \n Thank you for your interest!"
